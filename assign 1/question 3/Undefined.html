      <h3>All about Null and Undefined</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value.
          It is one of JavaScript's primitive values and is treated as falsy for
          boolean operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Difference between null and undefined</strong>
          <br />
          null === undefined => false and <br />
          null == undefined => true
        </li>
        <li>
          Undefined is also a primitive value in JavaScript. A variable or an
          object has an undefined value when no value is assigned before using
          it.
        </li>
        <li>
          We can assign null to a variable to denote that currently that
          variable does not have any value but it will have later on. A null
          means basicaly, absence of a value.
        </li>
